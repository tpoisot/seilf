# seilf

Uses `hylla` to look at references in the browser. Start with `node index.js`
and go to `localhost:3000`. Click on a reference in the list to have it
displayed in the left bar.

If you want to make changes to the code, it's recommended to use `supervisor`
instead:

~~~ sh
sudo npm install -g supervisor
supervisor index.js
~~~

By the way... *hylla* is Swedish for shelf, and *seilf* is Irish for the exact
same thing.
